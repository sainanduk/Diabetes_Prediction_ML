# Diabetes Prediction ML

Welcome to the Diabetes Prediction ML repository! This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of diabetes in individuals using machine learning techniques. Diabetes prediction is a crucial task in healthcare, and this project aims to contribute by implementing and evaluating machine learning models on relevant data.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a dataset related to diabetes, containing various health-related features.

## Project Structure
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sainanduk/Diabetes_Prediction_ML.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Diabetes_Prediction_ML
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Jupyter Notebook

Explore and run the machine learning model in the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/diabetes_prediction.ipynb
```

Follow the step-by-step instructions and execute the cells to train the model and make predictions.

### Python Script

To use the machine learning model in a Python script, follow these steps:

1. Open the `src/predict.py` script:

   ```bash
   nano src/predict.py
   ```

2. Modify the script to input your health-related data and obtain predictions.

3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python src/predict.py
   ```

## Model Evaluation

The project includes model evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the machine learning model. These metrics may include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
